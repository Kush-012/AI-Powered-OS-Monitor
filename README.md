   - **CPU Usage**: Displays live CPU usage as a percentage.
   - **Network Usage**: Tracks network usage in MB/s.
   - **Disk Usage**: Monitors disk usage as a percentage.

2. **AI-Powered Forecasting**:
   - Uses the **ARIMA** time-series model to predict future CPU usage.
   - Forecasts the next 10 time steps based on historical data.

3. **Interactive Dashboard**:
   - Built using **Dash** and **Plotly** for interactive and responsive graphs.
   - Styled with **Bootstrap** and custom CSS for a modern look.

4. **Data Persistence**:
